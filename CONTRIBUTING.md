How to contribute

The goal of this project was to wrap the Twitter API in R. Please take note of the Code of Conduct for this project as everyone who participates in it is expected to uphold these guidelines.

Testing

Unit tests should be made for every function. Integration tests are also required.

Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to twitterapiR with a clear list of what you have done (read more about pull requests). Please follow our coding conventions below and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Coding conventions

This code should follow the tidyverse style guide.

Thanks,
